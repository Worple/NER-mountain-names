I failed to implement the solution for the given task due to time constraints, however, I have developed some preliminary ideas on how to tackle this challenge. Initially, I am considering adapting the main concept of the output layer of YOLO (You Only Look Once) to the approach proposed by Dazhao FAN, Yang DONG, and Yongsheng ZHANG in their work 'Satellite Image Matching Method Based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network' (Journal of Geodesy and Geoinformation Science, 2019, 2(2): 90-100). This method could potentially enhance image matching capabilities for satellite imagery.

Moreover, I believe performance could be significantly improved by accessing raw data from the satellite sensor. My hypothesis is that the color images created by satellite cameras are based on the same technology used in modern digital cameras, namely the Bayer filter. By utilizing raw images directly from this filter, and avoiding the demosaicing process of image rendering, we could potentially reduce the volume of the input layer of the neural network by a factor of three without losing any information. This approach not only conserves computational resources but also maintains the integrity of the original data, which is crucial for accurate image analysis and matching.
